# S05 — Event Dashboard

**Purpose:** The hub screen. Everything about one event, role-aware.
**Visible to:** All event members (admin and member views differ).
**Rails:** R01, R02, R03, R04, R05, R06, R07, R08, R09 (all rails pass through here)
**Scenarios:** All

This is the most important screen in the app. Every journey passes through it. Its load-time orchestration (7 parallel API calls) is the most performance-critical path.

## Wireframe — Event Type Badge (CR-003)

Ongoing events display a badge next to the event name, and the summary stats area shows the current period:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  ← McKinnon Household 📅    │
│    Ongoing                   │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│                              │
│  ┌────────┐┌────────┐┌─────┐│
│  │ $847   ││ 2      ││  5  ││
│  │ total  ││ people ││ txn ││
│  └────────┘└────────┘└─────┘│
│  Current period: since       │
│  31 Jan 2026 (3 txns)       │
```

One-off (singular) events do not show a badge — that is the default. The period indicator only appears on ongoing events when at least one settlement bookmark exists.

## Wireframe — Linked Events (CR-003)

When an event has EVENT_LINKs (from decomposition or other linking), a "Linked Events" card appears below the main content:

```
│  Linked Events               │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ ← Friday Dinner with     ││
│  │   Dave & Lisa             ││
│  │   Decomposition · $200   ││
│  │   [View source event →]  ││
│  ├──────────────────────────┤│
│  │ → McKinnon Household     ││
│  │   Decomposition · $200   ││
│  │   [View target event →]  ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

Links are grouped by direction: "←" for events that linked *into* this event (as_target), "→" for events this event linked *to* (as_source). Tapping a link navigates to the linked event's S05 dashboard.

## Wireframe — Post-Settlement Decomposition Prompt (CR-003)

After all settlements in an event are marked paid, if any settlement involved a shared PFG, the dashboard shows a decomposition prompt:

```
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ 🎉 All settled!           ││
│  │                           ││
│  │ Your household paid       ││
│  │ $200 as a couple.         ││
│  │ Split it between you?     ││
│  │                           ││
│  │ [Decompose →]  [Dismiss]  ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

This prompt only appears once per settlement cycle. "Decompose →" opens the same decomposition flow as S12 (R09 rail). "Dismiss" hides the prompt permanently for this settlement.

## Wireframe — Multi-Currency Balances (CR-002)

When an event contains transactions in multiple currencies, the balance section displays per-currency totals instead of a single aggregate number:

```
│  Your Balance                │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │  AUD  You owe $142.50    ││
│  │  USD  You're owed $23.00 ││
│  │  EUR  You owe €18.00     ││
│  │                          ││
│  │  ┌────────────────────┐  ││
│  │  │   Settle Up        │  ││
│  │  └────────────────────┘  ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

Each currency row follows the same colour conventions: red for "You owe", green for "You're owed". The "Settle Up" button is shown if the user owes in any currency. The summary stats row at the top also groups totals by currency when multiple currencies are present:

```
│  ┌────────┐┌────────┐┌─────┐│
│  │AUD $947││USD $300││  3  ││
│  │ total  ││ total  ││ txn ││
│  └────────┘└────────┘└─────┘│
```

> The positions endpoint (`GET /events/{eid}/positions`) returns positions keyed by currency. The frontend groups and renders one balance row per currency. Single-currency events display as before with no grouping header.

## Wireframe — Event Limits (Free Tier)

When an event is unfunded (free tier), the dashboard displays current usage against limits so users understand remaining capacity:

```
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │  Free Tier Limits         ││
│  │  Persons:     4 / 5       ││
│  │  Expenses:    1 / 1       ││
│  │  Groups:      1 / 1       ││
│  │  Settlements: not available││
│  │                           ││
│  │  [Fund This Event →]      ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

Limits data comes from the event object's `limits` field, which includes `person_limit`, `transaction_limit`, `group_limit` and current usage counts. The limits section is hidden for funded events. For members (non-admin), the "Fund This Event" link is replaced with "Contact your event admin to unlock full features."

## Wireframe — Split-Pending Expenses

When transactions have `splits_status: "pending"`, they display with a pending indicator instead of payer info:

```
│  Recent Expenses             │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ Pizza            $45.00  ││
│  │ ⏳ splits pending         ││
│  ├──────────────────────────┤│
│  │ Drinks           $30.00  ││
│  │ ⏳ splits pending         ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

Once people are added and splits are auto-assigned, these revert to the normal display showing payer and per-person amounts.

## Wireframe — Admin Extras

Admin sees everything above, plus:

```
│  ⚠️ 2 pending actions        │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ Dave awaiting approval   ││
│  │ [Approve]  [Reject]      ││
│  ├──────────────────────────┤│
│  │ Bob's taxi needs review  ││
│  │ [Review]                 ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
│                              │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ ⚙️ Event Settings    ▸   ││
│  │ 💳 Funding Status    ▸   ││
│  │ 📋 Audit Log         ▸   ││
│  │ 📋 Save as Template   ▸   ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

> **Audit Log (JF-6):** The "Audit Log" link is visible to admin users only. It navigates to a view powered by `GET /events/{eid}/audit-log`, which returns a chronological list of all modifications, settlements, voids, and role changes for the event. Members do not see this link.

> **Modification badge (CR-021):** The event response now includes `pending_modification_count`. When > 0, the Admin Extras card shows a badge (e.g., "3 pending") next to the "Modification Requests" link. This count is also available to non-admin members for their own pending requests.

## Wireframe — Pending Approval State

When a member has joined but not yet been approved:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Bali Trip                 │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│                              │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ ⏳ Awaiting Approval      ││
│  │ The event admin needs to ││
│  │ approve your access.     ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
│                              │
│  (event details visible but  │
│   actions disabled)          │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Contact redaction (CR-021):** When the viewer's role status is `pending_approval`, the persons list redacts `email_hint` and `phone_hint` (returned as null). The pending member sees participant names and counts but not contact details. This is enforced server-side — no client-side filtering needed.

## Wireframe — Self-Merge Prompt (Member View)

When `GET /events/{eid}/persons/my-matches` returns a match for the current user:

```
|  +----------------------------+|
|  | We found a match!          ||
|  | "Dave" looks like you.     ||
|  | [This is me]  [Not me]     ||
|  +----------------------------+|
```

Tapping "This is me" calls `POST /events/{eid}/persons/{placeholder_id}/merge` with the user's person as target. `authorize_self_merge()` validates the match (email or display name).

## Wireframe — Voided Settlement Display (JF-1B, JF-5)

Settlements that have been voided display with audit fields showing who voided them and when:

```
│  Settlements                 │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ Bob → Alice    $85.00    ││
│  │ ✅ Confirmed · Jan 15     ││
│  ├──────────────────────────┤│
│  │ Dave → Alice   $42.00    ││
│  │ ❌ Voided · Jan 18        ││
│  │ by Alice · "entered in   ││
│  │ error"                    ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

The `voided_at` and `voided_by` fields are returned on settlement objects from `GET /events/{eid}/settlements`. Voided settlements are visually distinct (strikethrough or muted styling with the void reason displayed). These fields provide audit transparency so all participants can see when and why a settlement was reversed.

## Wireframe — Closed Event (Admin View)

When `event.status = closed`, admin sees a read-only dashboard with a reopen option:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Bali Trip           🔒   │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│                              │
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ 🔒 Event Closed           ││
│  │ This event has been       ││
│  │ closed. No new expenses   ││
│  │ or settlements can be     ││
│  │ created.                  ││
│  │                           ││
│  │ ┌────────────────────┐    ││
│  │ │   Reopen Event     │    ││  ← admin only
│  │ └────────────────────┘    ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
│                              │
│  (expenses and settlements   │
│   visible but read-only)     │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Reopen Event** calls `POST /events/{eid}/reopen` (or `PUT /events/{eid}` with `{status: "active"}`). After reopening, the FAB returns, settlement creation is re-enabled, and the closed banner disappears. Only admin can reopen.

## Orchestration — Page Load

```
1. GET /events/{eid}                    → event metadata (name, currency, status, limits,
                                           source_template_id, source_template_version,
                                           settlement_count)
2. GET /events/{eid}/persons            → person list + count
3. GET /events/{eid}/transactions       → transaction list (recent)
4. GET /events/{eid}/positions          → PFG positions + checksum (grouped by currency)
5. GET /events/{eid}/settlements        → settlement list + count (includes voided_at/voided_by)
6. GET /events/{eid}/event-roles        → pending approvals (admin only)
7. GET /events/{eid}/persons/my-matches → match suggestions for current user (member only)
8. GET /events/{eid}/links              → event links (decomposition, etc.) — as_source + as_target

Calls 2-8 parallelised after call 1 returns event metadata.
```

Call 1 returns the event's `limits` field when the event is unfunded, containing `person_limit`, `transaction_limit`, `group_limit`, and current usage counts. This drives the free tier limits display. Call 1 also returns `source_template_id`, `source_template_version` (if created from a template, CR-018), and `settlement_count` (number of paid settlements, CR-018). Call 4 returns positions keyed by currency for multi-currency balance rendering. Call 5 includes `voided_at` and `voided_by` audit fields on voided settlements.

### Template Provenance Display (CR-018)

When `source_template_id` is present on the event, the dashboard shows a provenance indicator:

```
│  ┌──────────────────────────┐│
│  │ Created from template     ││
│  │ "Friday Pub Crew" (v3)    ││
│  └──────────────────────────┘│
```

This is informational only — no actions are attached. The `settlement_count` is available for display in event stats if desired (e.g. "3 settlements completed").

### Event Activity Feed (CR-021)

The event dashboard can display recent event-scoped activity via `GET /events/{eid}/activity?page=1&page_size=10`. This complements the cross-event feed on S17 by showing only activity for the current event. Accepts the same `since` parameter for unread filtering.

**Display:** Inline on the dashboard as a "Recent Activity" card below the existing content, showing the 5 most recent items with a "View All" link navigating to S17 with `?event_id={eid}` filter applied.

**Orchestration — Page Load addition:**
```
(parallel with existing calls)
GET /events/{eid}/activity?page=1&page_size=5 → recent activity items
```

## Smart Defaults

- **"Your Balance"** card derived from current user's PFG net position
- **Transaction list** shows payer display_name + relative time ("2 days ago"), not raw timestamps
- **"Settle Up"** button only appears when user's PFG net < 0 (they owe money)
- **"You're owed"** variant appears when PFG net > 0 (green, no settle-up CTA)
- **"All settled"** badge when PFG net = $0.00
- **Split-pending expenses** show "⏳ splits pending" instead of payer info — transitions to normal display once splits are assigned
- **"Share Event →"** leads to S06 Prepare & Share — the recommended path for sharing with people attached
- **Invite link** always one tap to copy — quick access for admins who already know what they're doing
- **Pending actions** banner only shows for admins with pending items
- **Funding status** hidden unless event is unfunded and user is admin
- **Summary stats** (total, people, txn count) computed from loaded data — grouped by currency when the event has multiple currencies
- **Multi-currency balances** show one row per currency with independent owe/owed status and colour
- **Free tier limits** section shown only for unfunded events, with usage counts and a link to fund
- **Voided settlements** shown with strikethrough styling, void reason, and who voided them
- **Audit log** link shown for admins only, hidden for members
- **Event type badge:** "📅 Ongoing" shown next to event name for ongoing events; singular events show no badge (default)
- **Linked events** card shown only when `GET /events/{eid}/links` returns non-empty results; grouped by direction (source/target)
- **Save as Template** action visible to admin in overflow menu — creates template from current event's group structure via `POST /events/{eid}/save-as-template`
- **Post-settlement decomposition prompt** shown once when all settlements are paid and any involved a shared PFG; dismissible
- **Ongoing event period indicator** shows transaction count since last bookmark in the summary stats area
